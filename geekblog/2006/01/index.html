					<p>The Opera browser is <a href="http://my.opera.com/community/blog/show.dml/22627">now totally free</a>.  Opera started out as one of the few commercial competitors to Microsoft and Netscape&#8217;s free browsers. They later came out with an ad-supported version that you could use for free if you didn&#8217;t want to pay extra to get rid of the ads, and now they have finally eliminated the ads and made it entirely free.</p>
<p>This has apparently been out there for a while, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to have gotten much hype. Opera has long been considered one of the fastest and most standards compliant browsers available, but it&#8217;s commercial beginnings may have hurt its acceptance. It has its quirks, but it&#8217;s a pretty good browser that also includes a decent mail client and RSS reader, and all within an installed size that&#8217;s barely a third the size of Firefox.</p>
