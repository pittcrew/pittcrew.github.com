				<p>Those who have visited this blog before will probably notice a change in appearance. I never cared much for the default WordPress theme, but I browsed through who knows how many alternate themes in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/">theme gallery</a> and still didn&#8217;t find anything to my liking.</p>
<p>Then I decided to <a href="/geekblog/2006/04/12/first-time-riding-the-rails/">check out Ruby on Rails</a> a couple of months ago, so I set up a test blog using <a href="http://typosphere.org/">Typo</a> because it is one of the best open source examples of a complete Rails application. From there I discovered Packagethief&#8217;s <a href="http://quotedprintable.com/">Quoted-Printable</a> blog and the <a href="http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish">Scribbish</a> theme. Here&#8217;s a snippet that I posted to my test blog at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve always preferred page designs that are simple and clean, lightweight to load, and yet still pleasing to the eye. Scribbish fits those criteria perfectly. I just wish there was a WordPress-compatible version that I could use on my public blog!</p></blockquote>
<p>I recently had a little time to kill, so I set out to create the WordPress version myself and <a href="/geekblog/scribbishwp">ScribbishWP</a> was born. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user in search of an awesome theme then check it out, and give a shout out to Packagethief for a great visual design.</p>

            <p>I&#8217;m very picky when it comes to themes but I do like this one a lot, thanks for your work. Yesterday I&#8217;ve implemented it <a href="http://www.remcobron.com" rel="nofollow">on my website</a> and am very pleased with it. I&#8217;ve made some minor adjustments / additions like a menu-bar on top (which I&#8217;m not completly happy with yet) and I&#8217;ve widgetized the sidebar for added convenience.</p>
<p>Thanks for a great theme!</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s a good idea to submit it at oswd.org and/or themes.wordpress.net so others can benfit from it as well!</p>
