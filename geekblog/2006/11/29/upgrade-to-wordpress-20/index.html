				<p>I finally upgraded the blog to run on WordPress 2.0. I&#8217;ve been holding off on this for awhile because I just haven&#8217;t had the time to deal with it. I&#8217;m happy to report, though, that the upgrade went just as smoothly as the WordPress documentation claims.</p>
<p>After backing up the database and files from the previous blog installation, I downloaded the ZIP file for WordPress 2.0.5, extracted the files to my local disk, and uploaded them to my host server with FileZilla. I then entered the URL of the upgrade script into the browser, clicked the Upgrade link, and voila!</p>
<p>Now why can&#8217;t all software upgrades go this smoothly?</p>
