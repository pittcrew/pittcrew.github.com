				<p>This past week, Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/its-about-time.html">released</a> the new <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> service.  I&#8217;ve really become a big fan of <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>, and it looks like this may be another service that I&#8217;ll be getting a bit of use out of.</p>
<p>My wife has been trying to get me to keep better track of our various family events and appointments, but I find the process a bit cumbersome.   She puts together a calendar on paper, which I then have to take to work and transcribe into my Outlook calendar.  Once the data is in Outlook, things work pretty well as long as I&#8217;m at work.  But if I&#8217;m at home, I either have to connect to the VPN and Remote Desktop into my computer at work so I can bring up Outlook, or just ask my wife like I always did before.</p>
<p>With Google Calendar, we can each have a personal calendar that we share with each other so we can keep track of each other&#8217;s appointments.  We also set up a shared family calendar that we can both add appointments to.  And since it&#8217;s Web-based, I can access it anywhere, anytime.  It&#8217;s also integrated with Gmail so I can receive email reminders of upcoming events, use Calendar to send out event invitations, and easily add appointments for invitations that I receive.</p>
<p>This is definitely still a Beta service and it has some quirks and limitations.  It doesn&#8217;t yet support Safari on the Mac, and my wife <i>hates</i> the mini monthly calendar that doesn&#8217;t differentiate between the days of the selected month and the extra week or so that it shows from the previous and next months.  I&#8217;m sure Google will be making lots of improvements and bug fixes in the coming months, and probably adding some new features as well, but it certainly shows a lot of promise as another one of those services that just becomes a part of your daily routine.</p>
