					<p>I recently purchased a <a href="http://www.u3.com/">U3</a>-enabled flash drive. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/">Password Safe</a> (originally from Bruce Schneier&#8217;s <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/">Counterpane Labs</a>, now a SourceForge project) for some time now to store my passwords, and it seemed like a perfect application to have on a flash drive. I was shocked when I discovered that they wanted $9.95 for the <a href="http://software.u3.com/Product_Details.aspx?productId=294&#038;Selection=7">U3 version</a> of a free utility!</p>
<p>Well, the <a href="http://www.u3.com/developers/deploymentkit_sc.aspx">U3 Developer Kit</a> is available for a free registration and Password Safe is Open Source, so I decided to see if I could build my own U3 version. It turned out to be easier than I thought. The standard binary distribution of Password Safe already includes all of the necessary U3 support. I just followed the U3 packaging guidelines along with some pathnames gleaned from the Password Safe source to lay out the U3 package. I then used the U3 tools to generate the manifest file and configure the various actions. I even wrote a little device install utility as an <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">NSIS</a> script to make sure the default data directory gets created when installing to the flash drive.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hereby making available the final result under the same <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php">Artistic License</a> terms as Password Safe itself. This is based on the 3.10 version of Password Safe, but I will attempt to provide updates whenever I happen to notice a new release of the original binaries. Feel free to <a href="mailto:kenny.pitt@gmail.com">email me</a> if you have any feedback. I simply ask that you remember I had nothing to do with the original Password Safe program, only the packaging.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.pittcrew.net/projects/U3/pwsafe/pwsafe-u3-3.10-installer.exe">U3 Installer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://download.pittcrew.net/projects/U3/pwsafe/pwsafe-u3-3.10-src.zip">Source</a><br />
        The source ZIP contains just the source files for the U3 packaging. You&#8217;ll need to obtain the program binaries from Password Safe and the <code>U3Action.exe</code> from the U3 Developer Tools, then place the files according to the directory listing in <code>package_dir.txt</code>. You can also get the U3P2EXE tool from the U3 site to build the executable installer package.

					<p>This past week, Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/its-about-time.html">released</a> the new <a href="http://calendar.google.com/">Google Calendar</a> service.  I&#8217;ve really become a big fan of <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>, and it looks like this may be another service that I&#8217;ll be getting a bit of use out of.</p>
<p>My wife has been trying to get me to keep better track of our various family events and appointments, but I find the process a bit cumbersome.   She puts together a calendar on paper, which I then have to take to work and transcribe into my Outlook calendar.  Once the data is in Outlook, things work pretty well as long as I&#8217;m at work.  But if I&#8217;m at home, I either have to connect to the VPN and Remote Desktop into my computer at work so I can bring up Outlook, or just ask my wife like I always did before.</p>
<p>With Google Calendar, we can each have a personal calendar that we share with each other so we can keep track of each other&#8217;s appointments.  We also set up a shared family calendar that we can both add appointments to.  And since it&#8217;s Web-based, I can access it anywhere, anytime.  It&#8217;s also integrated with Gmail so I can receive email reminders of upcoming events, use Calendar to send out event invitations, and easily add appointments for invitations that I receive.</p>
<p>This is definitely still a Beta service and it has some quirks and limitations.  It doesn&#8217;t yet support Safari on the Mac, and my wife <i>hates</i> the mini monthly calendar that doesn&#8217;t differentiate between the days of the selected month and the extra week or so that it shows from the previous and next months.  I&#8217;m sure Google will be making lots of improvements and bug fixes in the coming months, and probably adding some new features as well, but it certainly shows a lot of promise as another one of those services that just becomes a part of your daily routine.</p>

					<p>The Opera browser is <a href="http://my.opera.com/community/blog/show.dml/22627">now totally free</a>.  Opera started out as one of the few commercial competitors to Microsoft and Netscape&#8217;s free browsers. They later came out with an ad-supported version that you could use for free if you didn&#8217;t want to pay extra to get rid of the ads, and now they have finally eliminated the ads and made it entirely free.</p>
<p>This has apparently been out there for a while, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to have gotten much hype. Opera has long been considered one of the fastest and most standards compliant browsers available, but it&#8217;s commercial beginnings may have hurt its acceptance. It has its quirks, but it&#8217;s a pretty good browser that also includes a decent mail client and RSS reader, and all within an installed size that&#8217;s barely a third the size of Firefox.</p>

					<p>Via <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4d139743-1b0f-422c-943f-7d13db1472bb">Scott Hanselman</a>, you can now display a web page with Internet Explorer directly inside a Firefox tab. The extension is called <a href="http://ietab.mozdev.org/">IE Tab</a>, and it provides similar functionality to the older <a href="http://ieview.mozdev.org/">IE View</a> except that it embeds Internet Explorer inside Firefox instead of opening a separate IE window. Once installed, you can right-click a page in Firefox and switch to IE mode without switching tabs. You can also right-click a link and open the link in a new IE tab. You can even configure a list of sites that will always display in an IE tab!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not perfect yet, but 99% of the time it does a fantastic job. <a href="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/">Netscape 8.0</a> has a similar feature, but I find it a bit cumbersome and I really like being able to do it directly in Firefox.</p>

					<p>Philipp Lenssen posted some <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-08-25-n18.html">tips for Google Talk</a>. Be sure to read the comments, too, for additional tips discovered by readers.</p>
<p>My favorite tip is adding emphasis in messages using the <strong>*bold*</strong> and <em>_italic_</em> convention that has been commonly used in plain-text e-mail and Usenet posts for years. I&#8217;ve never been one to use a lot of formatting in IM&#8217;s, so this is perfect for me. Simple, clean, gets the job done.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;m a little behind the times in blogging about this, but I needed to actually have a blog first. Rumors have been flying for a while that Google was planning to release its own IM service, and now <a href="http://talk.google.com/">Google Talk</a> is here. It is based on the <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> protocol, but it isn&#8217;t yet linked into the Jabber server network.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t find any fancy features in the minimalist client program, but that can sometimes be a good thing as it seems to use far fewer system resources than most other clients. If you want a more feature-rich client, you should be able to connect with any client that supports Jabber. You&#8217;ll also need to use a different client if you are not running on Windows, because the Google Talk client is currently a Windows-only application.</p>
<p>Currently, you can only chat with other Google Talk users, although Google <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/about.html#open">promises that they are committed to interoperability</a>. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know of any friends that are on Google Talk yet, so I can&#8217;t give it a thorough test in daily use.</p>
