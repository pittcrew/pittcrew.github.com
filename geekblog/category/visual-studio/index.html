					<p>I recently went through the unfortunate demise of the primary disk on my main development machine, so I had to rebuild my dev environment from scratch. I have a test server running SQL Server 2005, so I decided to install SQL Server 2008 on my dev machine for compatibility testing. Imagine my frustration when I tried to load up my database project in Visual Studio 2008 and was told that I needed a local instance of SQL Server 2005!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Microsoft has a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/archive/2008/11/25/visual-studio-team-system-2008-database-edition-gdr-rtm.aspx">new GDR release of Database Edition</a> that adds support for SQL Server 2008. Unfortunately, this isn&#8217;t just a service pack, it&#8217;s more like a product upgrade. An upgrade of your database project is required, and the project will no longer be usable by other developers on the team if they haven&#8217;t upgraded to the GDR release also. Oh well, I guess you can&#8217;t have everything.</p>
