					<p>It looks like this blog was recently hacked with a rather nasty, malware-distributing trojan, and apparently this has been a rather wide-spread problem. Hopefully there weren&#8217;t too many visitors turned away by the &#8220;Warning &#8211; visiting this web site may harm your computer!&#8221; message from Google. Here is a blog article with <a href="http://www.tipstrickstoolstechniques.com/?p=113">more information</a> about the problem. I deleted all of the WordPress files and upgraded to WordPress 2.5.1, then reloaded all of the ScribbishWP theme files from a backup. Finally, I had to hand-clean my WordPress config files and a few static HTML files. I asked for a Google review of the site after the cleanup and it looks like we&#8217;re in the clear for now, but please <a href="mailto:kenny.pitt@gmail.com">email me</a> if you notice anything like this happening again!</p>

					<p>The company I work for, <a href="http://www.spidynamics.com/">SPI Dynamics</a>, is a Microsoft VSIP partner. The Visual Studio Integration team from Microsoft held a special partner-only tailgate party last night at Dodger Stadium with tickets to the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Colorado Rockies game. I&#8217;m not a sports fanatic, and being from Atlanta I&#8217;m definately not a Dodgers fan (Go Braves!), but sitting in the second row of the field level just inside the right field foul pole was a pretty cool experience even for a geek.</p>

					<p>Next week I&#8217;m heading out to Los Angeles for the Microsoft Professional Developers Conference. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll learn about a lot of cool new technologies that I won&#8217;t be able to take advantage of yet, but hopefully I&#8217;ll at least be able to find some time when I get back to blog about a few of them.</p>

					<p>My name is Kenny Pitt. Very few people have ever heard of me, and I don&#8217;t expect that to change just because I started a blog. I&#8217;ll probably lose interest in this after a month or two and stop posting, but who knows?</p>
<p>I created this blog for all the geeky, technical stuff that nobody over on my <a href="/news">family blog</a> is going to want to read. It&#8217;s a place for me to capture links to cool applications, useful technical info, occasional thoughts about programming, and maybe even a code snippet or two. If anyone but me finds this interesting or useful, I&#8217;ll be amazed, but please let me know if you do.</p>
