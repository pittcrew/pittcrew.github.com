      <h1>ScribbishWP Theme</h1>
        
			<p><a href="http://quotedprintable.com/">Packagethief</a> (aka Jeffrey Allan Hardy) has created an awesome theme for <a href="http://typosphere.org/">Typo</a> called <a href="http://quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish">Scribbish</a>. As a WordPress user, I was extremely jealous because I have been unable to find a theme that comes anywhere close to the same simplicity and elegance. So with Jeff&#8217;s permission, I created a WordPress version of the Scribbish theme which I&#8217;ve dubbed ScribbishWP.</p>
<p>ScribbishWP attempts to format posts according to the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hAtom microformat specification</a>. I&#8217;ve validated the output on the PittGeek blog using <a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/hatom2atom/">hatom2atom</a> and it currently parses correctly. Note that all of your post content must be valid XHTML to produce hAtom-compliant output.</p>
<p>ScribbishWP has only been tested on WordPress 2.2. Your mileage may vary on other versions. I&#8217;ve also only tested it with the blog options that I use so there may be some areas that will not display properly with other options. In particular, the popup comment entry window has not been themed yet.</p>
<p>There are several style variations available in ScribbishWP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original-width or wide-width layout</li>
<li>Scribbish 2.0 or Scribbish 3.0 header styles</li>
<li>Right or left sidebar position</li>
</ul>
<p>The defaults are original-width layout, right sidebar, and Scribbish 2.0 header styles because that is what I use on this blog. You can change the defaults by editing the <code>style.css</code> file. Just look for the commented sections.</p>
