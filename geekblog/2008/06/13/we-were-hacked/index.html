				<p>It looks like this blog was recently hacked with a rather nasty, malware-distributing trojan, and apparently this has been a rather wide-spread problem. Hopefully there weren&#8217;t too many visitors turned away by the &#8220;Warning &#8211; visiting this web site may harm your computer!&#8221; message from Google. Here is a blog article with <a href="http://www.tipstrickstoolstechniques.com/?p=113">more information</a> about the problem. I deleted all of the WordPress files and upgraded to WordPress 2.5.1, then reloaded all of the ScribbishWP theme files from a backup. Finally, I had to hand-clean my WordPress config files and a few static HTML files. I asked for a Google review of the site after the cleanup and it looks like we&#8217;re in the clear for now, but please <a href="mailto:kenny.pitt@gmail.com">email me</a> if you notice anything like this happening again!</p>
