				<p>I&#8217;m a little behind the times in blogging about this, but I needed to actually have a blog first. Rumors have been flying for a while that Google was planning to release its own IM service, and now <a href="http://talk.google.com/">Google Talk</a> is here. It is based on the <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> <a href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> protocol, but it isn&#8217;t yet linked into the Jabber server network.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t find any fancy features in the minimalist client program, but that can sometimes be a good thing as it seems to use far fewer system resources than most other clients. If you want a more feature-rich client, you should be able to connect with any client that supports Jabber. You&#8217;ll also need to use a different client if you are not running on Windows, because the Google Talk client is currently a Windows-only application.</p>
<p>Currently, you can only chat with other Google Talk users, although Google <a href="http://www.google.com/talk/about.html#open">promises that they are committed to interoperability</a>. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know of any friends that are on Google Talk yet, so I can&#8217;t give it a thorough test in daily use.</p>
