				<p>My name is Kenny Pitt. Very few people have ever heard of me, and I don&#8217;t expect that to change just because I started a blog. I&#8217;ll probably lose interest in this after a month or two and stop posting, but who knows?</p>
<p>I created this blog for all the geeky, technical stuff that nobody over on my <a href="/news">family blog</a> is going to want to read. It&#8217;s a place for me to capture links to cool applications, useful technical info, occasional thoughts about programming, and maybe even a code snippet or two. If anyone but me finds this interesting or useful, I&#8217;ll be amazed, but please let me know if you do.</p>
