				<p>The company I work for, <a href="http://www.spidynamics.com/">SPI Dynamics</a>, is a Microsoft VSIP partner. The Visual Studio Integration team from Microsoft held a special partner-only tailgate party last night at Dodger Stadium with tickets to the Los Angeles Dodgers vs. Colorado Rockies game. I&#8217;m not a sports fanatic, and being from Atlanta I&#8217;m definately not a Dodgers fan (Go Braves!), but sitting in the second row of the field level just inside the right field foul pole was a pretty cool experience even for a geek.</p>
