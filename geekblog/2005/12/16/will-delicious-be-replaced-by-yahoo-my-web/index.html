				<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> for a while now, not so much for the &#8220;social networking&#8221; aspects of it but because it&#8217;s a great way to keep track of all the useful and interesting stuff I find scattered around the Web.  Not too long ago, Yahoo! debuted a similar service as part of its <a href="http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/">My Web 2.0 Beta</a>. I gave it a try and found that it had a nice UI and a few enhancements like the ability to limit who can see your links, but also a few drawbacks (in particular, no option to rename an existing tag). All-in-all, I didn&#8217;t see any compelling reason to switch, especially since all my existing bookmarks are already saved in del.icio.us.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html">Yahoo has purchased del.icio.us</a>, which begs the question of what the future holds for these two services. One thing is certain, Yahoo! doesn&#8217;t need two separate bookmark tagging services so something is bound to change. Which one will stay and which one will go? What new features will be added as the services are merged? I guess we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.</p>
