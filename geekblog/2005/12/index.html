					<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> for a while now, not so much for the &#8220;social networking&#8221; aspects of it but because it&#8217;s a great way to keep track of all the useful and interesting stuff I find scattered around the Web.  Not too long ago, Yahoo! debuted a similar service as part of its <a href="http://myweb2.search.yahoo.com/">My Web 2.0 Beta</a>. I gave it a try and found that it had a nice UI and a few enhancements like the ability to limit who can see your links, but also a few drawbacks (in particular, no option to rename an existing tag). All-in-all, I didn&#8217;t see any compelling reason to switch, especially since all my existing bookmarks are already saved in del.icio.us.</p>
<p>Now <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/yahoo.html">Yahoo has purchased del.icio.us</a>, which begs the question of what the future holds for these two services. One thing is certain, Yahoo! doesn&#8217;t need two separate bookmark tagging services so something is bound to change. Which one will stay and which one will go? What new features will be added as the services are merged? I guess we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.</p>

					<p>Via <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4d139743-1b0f-422c-943f-7d13db1472bb">Scott Hanselman</a>, you can now display a web page with Internet Explorer directly inside a Firefox tab. The extension is called <a href="http://ietab.mozdev.org/">IE Tab</a>, and it provides similar functionality to the older <a href="http://ieview.mozdev.org/">IE View</a> except that it embeds Internet Explorer inside Firefox instead of opening a separate IE window. Once installed, you can right-click a page in Firefox and switch to IE mode without switching tabs. You can also right-click a link and open the link in a new IE tab. You can even configure a list of sites that will always display in an IE tab!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not perfect yet, but 99% of the time it does a fantastic job. <a href="http://browser.netscape.com/ns8/">Netscape 8.0</a> has a similar feature, but I find it a bit cumbersome and I really like being able to do it directly in Firefox.</p>
