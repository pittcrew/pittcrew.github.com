					<p>We&#8217;re finally back after some extended downtime. Obviously I don&#8217;t get around to updating the site very often, so I&#8217;m sure it comes as no surprise that I didn&#8217;t notice the problem right away. A big thanks to <a href="http://quotedprintable.com/">Jeffrey</a> who emailed to inform me that ScribbishWP was unavailable. All of the static content on the site was accessible, but all of the WordPress-powered pages were down. It took technical support a week to track down and fix the problem, but as of last night everything seems to be working again.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;ve been having trouble accessing <a href="/geekblog/scribbishwp/">ScribbishWP</a>, give it another try now. And stay tuned for a long-overdue update in the near future (I&#8217;m putting that in writing in the hopes that it will motivate me to finally wrap this up).</p>
