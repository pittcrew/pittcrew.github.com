					<p>I recently purchased a <a href="http://www.u3.com/">U3</a>-enabled flash drive. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/">Password Safe</a> (originally from Bruce Schneier&#8217;s <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/">Counterpane Labs</a>, now a SourceForge project) for some time now to store my passwords, and it seemed like a perfect application to have on a flash drive. I was shocked when I discovered that they wanted $9.95 for the <a href="http://software.u3.com/Product_Details.aspx?productId=294&#038;Selection=7">U3 version</a> of a free utility!</p>
<p>Well, the <a href="http://www.u3.com/developers/deploymentkit_sc.aspx">U3 Developer Kit</a> is available for a free registration and Password Safe is Open Source, so I decided to see if I could build my own U3 version. It turned out to be easier than I thought. The standard binary distribution of Password Safe already includes all of the necessary U3 support. I just followed the U3 packaging guidelines along with some pathnames gleaned from the Password Safe source to lay out the U3 package. I then used the U3 tools to generate the manifest file and configure the various actions. I even wrote a little device install utility as an <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">NSIS</a> script to make sure the default data directory gets created when installing to the flash drive.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hereby making available the final result under the same <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php">Artistic License</a> terms as Password Safe itself. This is based on the 3.10 version of Password Safe, but I will attempt to provide updates whenever I happen to notice a new release of the original binaries. Feel free to <a href="mailto:kenny.pitt@gmail.com">email me</a> if you have any feedback. I simply ask that you remember I had nothing to do with the original Password Safe program, only the packaging.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/projects/U3/pwsafe/pwsafe-u3-3.10-installer.exe">U3 Installer</a></li>
<li><a href="/projects/U3/pwsafe/pwsafe-u3-3.10-src.zip">Source</a><br />
        The source ZIP contains just the source files for the U3 packaging. You&#8217;ll need to obtain the program binaries from Password Safe and the <code>U3Action.exe</code> from the U3 Developer Tools, then place the files according to the directory listing in <code>package_dir.txt</code>. You can also get the U3P2EXE tool from the U3 site to build the executable installer package.
