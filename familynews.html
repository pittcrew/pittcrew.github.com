      <h2>August 28, 2005</h2>
      <p>Well, as you can see, it's been well over a year and a half since the last news update.  I had intended to update a <em>little</em> more often than that, but you know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men.  The process of adding new content was cumbersome and error-prone.  At least once, I even lost an entire entry because I	accidentally updated from an old copy of the page.</p>
      <p>So I've decided to try a different approach.  This family news page has been replaced by the <a href="/news/">PittCrew News blog</a>.  Now I can just write the content, and let the blog software deal with all the overhead of publishing and archiving the entries.  You can read more about the features of the new blog format in <a href="http://pittcrew.net/news/2005/08/27/welcome-to-the-family-news-blog/">my first blog post</a>.</p>

      <h2>December 11, 2003</h2>
      <p>The entire Pitt Crew has now reached the brown belt level in Tae Kwon Do.  Terri and Kenny moved up from red belt to their first stripe brown belt, and Jennifer and David both received their second stripe brown belts.  After the third brown belt stripe, the next level will be black belt.</p>

      <h2>December 4, 2003</h2>
      <p>David is very excited because he finally lost his first tooth!  It had been loose for quite a while, but just didn't want to let go.  The permanent tooth was already starting to come in behind it so he may not have a gap for too long, but the tooth next to it is already loose also and he may soon be losing another one.</p>

      <h2>September 27, 2003</h2>
      <p>The Pitt Crew has a new member!  Her name is <b>Nutmeg</b>, and she is a Siberian Dwarf Hamster.  She is about half the size of a typical hamster, and she is very cute and playful (although she sleeps a lot during the day as most hamsters do).  You can learn more about Dwarf Hamsters on the <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/small_animal/answers/breed_guide/articles/article_4075.shtml">PetSmart web site</a>.</p>

      <h2>July 6, 2003</h2>
      <p>The Pitt Crew competed in the AAU National Tae Kwon Do Championships this weekend along with the rest of the <a href="http://www.minterkarate.com/">Charles Minter Tae Kwon Do</a> Competition Team.  Our team sent 61 athletes to the championships, and a total of 1,658 athletes competed with over 40 states represented.  Jennifer, Terri, and Kenny all won gold medals in point sparring.  Kenny also won a bronze medal in forms.  David unfortunately did not win any medals, but he had a good time nonetheless and there were many black belts who did not fair any better.</p>

      <h2>April 26, 2003</h2>
      <p>David got his first pair of eyeglasses today.  Since he was the only member of the Pitt Crew still capable of seeing with his own eyes, we knew it was only a matter of time.  He is actually very excited about it, and says he "isn't embarrassed at all" to wear his glasses at school.</p>
