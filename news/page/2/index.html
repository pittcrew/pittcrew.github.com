					<p>The Pitt Crew has a new member!  Her name is <b>Nutmeg</b>, and she is a Siberian Dwarf Hamster.  She is about half the size of a typical hamster, and she is very cute and playful (although she sleeps a lot during the day as most hamsters do).  You can learn more about Dwarf Hamsters on the <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/small_animal/answers/breed_guide/articles/article_4075.shtml">PetSmart web site</a>.</p>

					<p>The Pitt Crew competed in the AAU National Tae Kwon Do Championships this weekend along with the rest of the <a href="http://www.minterkarate.com/">Charles Minter Tae Kwon Do</a> Competition Team.  Our team sent 61 athletes to the championships, and a total of 1,658 athletes competed with over 40 states represented.  Jennifer, Terri, and Kenny all won gold medals in point sparring.  Kenny also won a bronze medal in forms.  David unfortunately did not win any medals, but he had a good time nonetheless and there were many black belts who did not fair any better.</p>

					<p>David got his first pair of eyeglasses today.  Since he was the only member of the Pitt Crew still capable of seeing with his own eyes, we knew it was only a matter of time.  He is actually very excited about it, and says he &#8220;isn&#8217;t embarrassed at all&#8221; to wear his glasses at school.</p>
