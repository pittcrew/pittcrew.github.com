title: David gets braces
---
David got his braces installed today.  The orthodontist wanted to go ahead and install them on the upper teeth to make more room for the permanent teeth to come in in the front.

Braces sure have changed. As you can see, there is very little metal showing besides the wires. And he even got to pick the colors!
