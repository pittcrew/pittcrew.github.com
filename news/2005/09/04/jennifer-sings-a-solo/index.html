title: Jennifer sings a solo
---
Jennifer sang her first true solo in church today, just her and the piano accompaniment in front of the whole congregation. Jennifer was very excited when she earned the solo part for the children's musical last spring, but unfortunately the musical had to be cancelled and she didn't get to sing. The choir director promised he would find another time when she could do her solo, so today she provided the music during Communion. She did a great job, and received a number of compliments afterwards!
