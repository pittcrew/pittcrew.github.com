			<h2>Jennifer makes first cut for All-State Chorus</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Jennifer had her audition for All-State Chorus on Saturday. Each student performed individually for two judges, and the scores of the two judges are averaged. A cutoff score will be set later based on the number of available spots in the Chorus. Jennifer found out her scores today and she received two perfect scores from her judges! Even though the final cutoff has not been set, she is guaranteed to make the cut.</p>
<p>There is a second audition in January, but it is mainly to make sure the students are making good progress learning the music for the All-State performance. So it looks like Jennnifer will be singing in Savannah in March. Congratulations, Jennnifer!</p>
