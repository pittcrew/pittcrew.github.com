			<h2>Gasoline craziness</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>It seems a bit of a panic has broken out here in Atlanta over a possible gasoline shortage. People are lining up at the pumps all over the Atlanta area, and a lot of stations are running dry. Some stations that still have gas available are jacking prices way up as a result. On my way home from work today, I personally saw a station charging $3.49/gal for Regular, but I heard several reports on the radio of prices over $5.00 or even $6.00/gal. It got so bad that the governor had to step in to <a href="http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2005/08/29/daily19.html">prevent further price gouging</a>.</p>
