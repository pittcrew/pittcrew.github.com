			<h2>Welcome to the Family News blog</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>The PittCrew Family News is now a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a>! I always intended for it to be somewhat blog-like, but adding content to the <a href="/familynews.html">old Family News page</a> involved too much overhead for quick updates. Now the blog software will manage that overhead for me, and allow me to dash off a quick post from any Web browser. I&#8217;m hoping that will lead to more frequent updates about all the semi-interesting (at least to us) little tidbits in our lives. We&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>Another feature of the new format is that readers can leave their own comments on a post. I&#8217;m asking that you register your name and e-mail address before posting a comment, but don&#8217;t worry because your e-mail address will never be exposed to other readers. Please register and post a comment to let us know how you like the new format.</p>
<p>And finally, for the geekier types like me, there is now an <a href="http://www.pittcrew.net/news/feed/">RSS feed</a> so that you can get updates without constantly checking the site to see if anything has changed.</p>
