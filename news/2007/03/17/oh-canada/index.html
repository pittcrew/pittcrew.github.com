			<h2>Oh, Canada!</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Tonight was St. Patrick&#8217;s Day at the <a href="http://www.gwinnettgladiators.com/">Gwinnett Gladiators</a> hockey game. The ice was green, and the arena was filled with 10,349 screaming fans. But wait! Who&#8217;s that walking out onto the ice?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Jennifer Pitt to perform <em>Oh, Canada</em>!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s right, Jennifer was singing solo in front of over 10,000 people at a professional hockey game. Oh yeah, and the Gladiators also won the game 5&mdash;1.</p>
