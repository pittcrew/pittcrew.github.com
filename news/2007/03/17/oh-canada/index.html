title: Oh, Canada!
---
<p>Tonight was St. Patrick's Day at the <a href="http://www.gwinnettgladiators.com/">Gwinnett Gladiators</a> hockey game. The ice was green, and the arena was filled with 10,349 screaming fans. But wait! Who's that walking out onto the ice?</p>

<blockquote>"Here's Jennifer Pitt to perform <em>Oh, Canada</em>!"</blockquote>

<p>That's right, Jennifer was singing solo in front of over 10,000 people at a professional hockey game. Oh yeah, and the Gladiators also won the game 5&mdash;1.</p>
