title: New dwarf hamster
---
<p>The Pitt Crew has a new member!  Her name is <b>Nutmeg</b>, and she is a Siberian Dwarf Hamster.  She is about half the size of a typical hamster, and she is very cute and playful (although she sleeps a lot during the day as most hamsters do).  You can learn more about Dwarf Hamsters on the <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/small_animal/answers/breed_guide/articles/article_4075.shtml">PetSmart web site</a>.</p>
