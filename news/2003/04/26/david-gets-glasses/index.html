title: David gets glasses
---
<p>David got his first pair of eyeglasses today.  Since he was the only member of the Pitt Crew still capable of seeing with his own eyes, we knew it was only a matter of time.  He is actually very excited about it, and says he "isn't embarrassed at all" to wear his glasses at school.</p>
