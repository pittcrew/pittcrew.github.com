					<p>The Pitt Crew competed in the AAU National Tae Kwon Do Championships this weekend along with the rest of the <a href="http://www.minterkarate.com/">Charles Minter Tae Kwon Do</a> Competition Team.  Our team sent 61 athletes to the championships, and a total of 1,658 athletes competed with over 40 states represented.  Jennifer, Terri, and Kenny all won gold medals in point sparring.  Kenny also won a bronze medal in forms.  David unfortunately did not win any medals, but he had a good time nonetheless and there were many black belts who did not fair any better.</p>
