			<h2>David loses his first tooth</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>David is very excited because he finally lost his first tooth!  It had been loose for quite a while, but just didn&#8217;t want to let go.  The permanent tooth was already starting to come in behind it so he may not have a gap for too long, but the tooth next to it is already loose also and he may soon be losing another one.</p>
